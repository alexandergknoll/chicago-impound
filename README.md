# Where in Chicago is my Car?

### Bummed is what you are when you get back to your car and it's been towed

'Where in Chicago is my Car?' allows you to reclaim your impounded vehicle from the City of Chicago.  Simply enter your license plate and the state that your vehicle is registered in to see if your vehicle was impounded in Chicago during the last 90 days.

The app is written in JavaScript and performs all requests client-side using jQuery, Ajax, and the City of Chicago Data Portal API.  The Google Maps API is used to render static maps to show users the location of the impounded vehicle alongside an address and a phone number to call with the vehicle's inventory number.
